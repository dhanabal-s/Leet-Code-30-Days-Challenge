# Problem

__Remove K Digits__

Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.

Note:</br>
The length of num is less than 10002 and will be ≥ k.</br>
The given num does not contain any leading zero.</br>

Example 1:</br>
Input: num = "1432219", k = 3</br>
Output: "1219"</br>
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.

Example 2:</br>
Input: num = "10200", k = 1</br>
Output: "200"</br>
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.

Example 3:</br>
Input: num = "10", k = 2</br>
Output: "0"</br>
Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.
