# Problem
__Sort Characters By Frequency__

Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.</br>

Example 1:</br>
Input:</br>
"tree"</br>
Output:</br>
"eert"</br>
Explanation:</br>
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.</br>
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.</br>

Example 2:</br>
Input:</br>
"cccaaa"</br>
Output:</br>
"cccaaa"</br>
Explanation:</br>
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.</br>
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.</br>

Example 3:</br>
Input:</br>
"Aabb"</br>
Output:</br>
"bbAa"</br>
Explanation:</br>
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.</br>
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.</br>
